# Topic:Fake news Detection
 Batch 2.
 By : Faaizathul Arfa

***Problem Defination:***

Developing a machine learning project to distinguish fake news from a real one.we can use supervised learning to implement the model.
 
***Introduction:***

The topic of fake news detection on social media has recently attracted tremendous attention. The basic countermeasure of comparing websites against a list of labeled fake news sources is inflexible, and so a machine learning approach is desirable. Our project aims to use detect fake news directly, based on the text content of news articles.
 
***Steps involved:***
 
 1. Analysing the dataset and cleanig the data.
 
 2. Data preparing.
 
 3. Building the machine learning models.
 
 4. evaluating the models for better accuracy.
 
## 1. Analysing the dataset and cleanig the data.
Dataset is in filename.csv form is read and displayed to get the idea of labels .first few lines of the file are displayed 
```
df=pd.read_csv('/content/news.csv')
df.head()
```
```
labels=df.label
print(labels.head())
```
## 2.Data preparation
splitting dataset arrays into two subsets.that is train and test set.This for training the model and test the accuracy.The test size is taken as 0.33

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X=df['text']
y=labels
X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.33)
```


### models used for classification:
### 1.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Faaizathul-arfa/my_project/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Faaizathul-arfa/my_project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
